# Introduction

This is a brochure for a GR course offered online by faculties at the Institute of Advanced Research, Ahmedabad where I have delivered a series of lectures on GR.
It is based on a special kind of wiki, called **TiddlyWiki**.  
It uses a list of text files in its syntax (you can use Markdown). Each file as a text `field` and other fields containing other attributes with one-to-one mapping of a `field value` and a `field name`. With interesting plugins you can make a general directed between different text files to create a flow of prerequisites while designing a course. 
It also contains scripts to manage directories (and sub directories) full of pdfs to create reference management. The similar implementation can be achived much easily using the plugin Bibtex-plugin. 
You can also create non-directed graphs to show the interlinking of a set of text files. You have to use a special plugin tiddlymaps for that purpose.
